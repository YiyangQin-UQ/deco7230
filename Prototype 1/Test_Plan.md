# Test Plan (Week 5 – Unity Prototype)

## Project Pitch
This is an XR-based virtual painting application. Users can hold a virtual brush to paint on a canvas, pick colors from a palette, and experience strokes that vary in thickness depending on the brush-to-canvas distance.  
The purpose is to test whether these interactions are intuitive and whether users can smoothly complete the painting workflow.  

---

## Testing Objectives
- Verify whether users can intuitively understand how to use the brush to paint on the canvas.  
- Verify whether users realize that the palette can be used for color picking and can successfully perform this action.  
- Test whether the varying brush thickness based on distance feels natural and usable.  
- Collect overall feedback on whether the interaction flow is intuitive and smooth.  

---

## Assumptions to Validate
1. Users will attempt to paint on the canvas without explicit instructions.  
2. Users will independently discover the palette’s color-picking function.  
3. Users will notice that brush strokes change thickness depending on distance.  
4. Users will consider the overall interaction logic natural and easy to learn.

## Prototype Description
- Platform: Unity prototype  
- Scene elements: Canvas, Palette, Brush  
- Implemented features:  
  - Painting on the canvas with the brush  
  - Picking colors from the palette  
  - Stroke thickness varies with brush-to-canvas distance  

---

## Methodology
- Testing environment: In-class, live prototype testing  
- Duration: ~5 minutes per participant  
- Data collection:  
  - Observation (whether participants need hints, whether they complete tasks)  
  - Post-experience questionnaire (rating scales + open-ended questions)  

---

## Testing Procedure
1. **Setup**  
   Open the Unity prototype and ensure the canvas, palette, and brush are functional.  

2. **Instruction to participants**  
   Say:  
   > “Please try using this brush and scene as you would in real life, and see what you can do. I will not give you any extra instructions.”  

3. **Interaction (approx. 3 minutes)**  
   Observe whether the participant:  
   - Paints on the canvas  
   - Attempts to pick colors from the palette  
   - Notices the stroke thickness changes with distance  

4. **Questionnaire (approx. 2 minutes)**  
   After the experience, the participant fills out a short questionnaire.  

---

## Data Collection
- **Observation log**: Record whether tasks were completed independently and note any confusion.  
- **Questionnaire**: Includes rating scales (intuitiveness, usability, naturalness) and open-ended questions (likes/dislikes, suggestions).  
- **Verbal feedback**: Note immediate comments or visible reactions.  

---

## Expected Results
- Most users will intuitively understand how to paint.  
- Some users may need hints to discover the palette’s color-picking feature.  
- Reactions to the stroke-thickness feature may vary, providing insights for iteration.  
- Feedback will guide improvements to the interaction design and user flow.
