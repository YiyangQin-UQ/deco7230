# Statement of Originality

I certify that the following components used in the creation of this prototype are my own original work unless otherwise stated.  

---

## Original Work
- Unity project setup and configuration for XR  
- Prototype design, scene layout, and interaction logic  
- Code implementation with AI assistance for guidance and debugging  
  *(AI mainly served as a teaching and error-correction tool, while integration, adaptation, and testing were performed by me)*  
- Adjustments to imported assets and scripts to fit the prototype requirements

## External Sources  

### VR Prototype Scene  
- **Source:** Painting Prop Set (Sketchfab community, Free)  
- **Author:** Sketchfab community  
- **Usage:** Imported as VR props (pen, palette, and board), rearranged and integrated with custom scripts for interaction

## Code Support (General Implementation)  
- **Assisted by:** ChatGPT (OpenAI)  
- **Usage:** AI was used for code suggestions, explanations, and debugging support. All integration, adjustments, and testing were done independently by me.
